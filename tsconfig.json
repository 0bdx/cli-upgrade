/**
 * This file tells VS Code's TypeScript server to highlight type errors in
 * JavaScript files in the src/ directory. You read that right: all our code is
 * plain JavaScript, not TypeScript, but the developer experience still benefits
 * from live type checking.
 *
 * This file is not related to the "build:types" and "preflight:types" scripts
 * in package.json:
 * - "build:types" generates the cli-upgrade.d.ts type declaration
 * - "preflight:types" checks that cli-upgrade.js uses all types correctly
